Performance Analysis
1.Sigmoid Function vs Linear piecewise:
	Compared the performance of Sigmoid and Linear functions obtainedafter running large number of computations and computational effort required to get Mean Squared Error of 0.013.
2.Tuning Hyper parameters to improve prediction accuracy:
	Modified the learning rate & back propagationalgorithm of Neural network to reduce the false positive rates while predicting the income of an adult.
3.Backpropagation vs SVM vs LVQ2
	Compared the performance of a backpropagation algorithm, upport Vector Machine and Linear Vector Quantiation2 on a classification problem.
